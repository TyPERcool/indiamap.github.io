        Sikkim (/ˈsɪkɪm/ SIK-im; Nepali pronunciation: [ˈsikːim]) is a state in
        northeastern India. It borders the Tibet Autonomous Region of China in
        the north and northeast, Bhutan in the east, Koshi Province of Nepal in
        the west, and West Bengal in the south. Sikkim is also close to the
        Siliguri Corridor, which borders Bangladesh. Sikkim is the least
        populous and second-smallest among the Indian states. Situated in the
        Eastern Himalaya, Sikkim is notable for its biodiversity, including
        alpine and subtropical climates, as well as being a host to
        Kangchenjunga, the highest peak in India and third-highest on
        Earth.Sikkim's capital and largest city is Gangtok. Almost 35% of the
        state is covered by Khangchendzonga National Park – a UNESCO World
        Heritage Site.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp; The Kingdom of Sikkim was founded by the Namgyal dynasty
        in the 17th century. It was ruled by Buddhist priest-kings known as the
        Chogyal. It became a princely state of the British Indian Empire in
        1890. Following Indian independence, Sikkim continued its protectorate
        status with the Union of India after 1947 and the Republic of India
        after 1950. It enjoyed the highest literacy rate and per capita income
        among Himalayan states. In 1973, anti-royalist riots took place in front
        of the Chogyal's palace. In 1975, after the Indian Army took over the
        city of Gangtok, a referendum was held that led to the dissolution of
        the monarchy and Sikkim joining India as its 22nd state.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp; Modern Sikkim
        is a multiethnic and multilingual Indian state. The official languages
        of the state are English, Nepali, Bhutia, and Lepcha. Additional
        official languages include Gurung, Limbu, Magar, Mukhia, Newari, Rai,
        Sherpa and Tamang for the purpose of preservation of culture and
        tradition in the state. English is taught in schools and used in
        government documents. The predominant religion is Hinduism, with a
        significant Vajrayana Buddhist minority. Sikkim's economy is largely
        dependent on agriculture and tourism. As of 2019, the state had the
        fifth-smallest GDP among Indian states, although it is also among the
        fastest-growing.</p>
