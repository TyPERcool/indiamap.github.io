        Bihar is a state in eastern India, known for its rich history, culture, and significant contributions to Indian civilization. It is bordered by Uttar Pradesh to the west, Nepal to the north, the northern part of West Bengal to the east, and Jharkhand to the south. Bihar is one of the oldest inhabited places in the world, with a history spanning 3,000 years. The region was home to the ancient kingdoms of Magadh, Mithila, and Anga, and it played a crucial role in the development of Indian culture and religion.
        <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp; Bihar is the birthplace of Buddhism and Jainism, with Gautama Buddha attaining enlightenment in Bodh Gaya and Lord Mahavira, the 24th Tirthankara of Jainism, being born in Vaishali. The state also played a significant role in the Indian independence movement, with leaders like Mahatma Gandhi initiating the Champaran Satyagraha against British rule from Bihar.
        <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp; Agriculture is the mainstay of Bihar's economy, with rice, wheat, and maize being the primary crops. The state has made strides in improving its infrastructure, education, and healthcare in recent years. However, it still faces challenges such as poverty, unemployment, and underdevelopment. Despite these challenges, Bihar has a rich cultural heritage, with festivals like Chhath Puja, Diwali, and Holi being celebrated with great fervor.
        <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp; The capital of Bihar is <strong>Patna</strong>, one of the oldest continuously inhabited cities in the world. Patna is situated on the southern bank of the Ganges River and serves as the administrative, economic, and educational center of Bihar. The city is a hub of culture and history, with landmarks such as the Golghar, Patna Sahib Gurudwara, and the Patna Museum.
